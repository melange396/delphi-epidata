# Getting Data Access

The Delphi Research Group at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), in partnership
with Facebook, has conducted the COVID Symptom Survey to better understand the
spread of COVID-19 and its effects on public health and well-being. This may
help improve our local and national responses to the pandemic and our
understanding of how it has affected society.

De-identified data can be made available to researchers associated with
universities or non-profit organizations. To request access to the data please
submit the information requested in [Facebook's page on obtaining data
access](https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/),
which sets out the basic conditions and provides a form to request access. An
[international version of the COVID Symptom Survey](https://covidmap.umd.edu/)
is conducted by the University of Maryland (UMD) and access can be requested
through the same form.
