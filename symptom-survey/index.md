# COVID Symptom Survey

Delphi conducts a voluntary COVID-19 symptom survey, distributed daily via a
partnership with Facebook. This survey asks respondents about COVID-like
symptoms, their behavior (such as social distancing), mental health, and
economic and health impacts they have experienced as a result of the pandemic. A
high-level overview of the survey is posted [on the COVIDcast
website](https://covidcast.cmu.edu/surveys.html).

Aggregate data from this survey is available through the [COVIDcast API](../api/covidcast.md)
as the [`fb-survey` data source](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md).

This documentation is for users who have a signed Data Use Agreement to receive
individual response data from the survey. It describes the survey items, data
coding, data distribution, and the survey weights computed by Facebook. If you
are a researcher and would like to get access to the data, check [Facebook's
page on obtaining data
access](https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/),
which sets out the basic conditions and provides a form to request access.
