# Contingency Tables
{: .no_toc}

This documentation describes the fine-resolution contingency tables produced by
grouping [COVID Symptom Survey](./index.md) individual responses by various
demographic features:

* [Weekly files](https://cmu.box.com/s/xwjulq0pteen52d4upni9ikagu7d8bl2)
* [Monthly files](https://cmu.box.com/s/vh4gs3j541tt9pqn2pn72bktu0op8tpo)

These contingency tables provide demographic breakdowns of COVID-related topics such as
vaccine uptake and acceptance. They are more detailed than the
[coarse aggregates reported in the COVIDcast Epidata API](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md),
which are grouped only by geographic region. [Individual response data](survey-files.md)
for the survey is available, but only to academic or nonprofit researchers who
sign a Data Use Agreement, whereas these contingency tables are available to the
general public.

Please see our survey [credits](index.md#credits) and [citation information](index.md#citing-the-survey)
for information on how to cite this data if you use it in a publication.

Important updates for data users, including corrections to data or updates on
data processing delays, are posted as `OUTAGES.txt` in the directory where the
data is hosted.

## Available Data Files

We provide two types of data files, weekly and monthly. Users who need the most
up-to-date data or are interested in timeseries should use the weekly files,
while those who want to study groups with smaller sample sizes should use the
monthly files. Because monthly aggregates include more responses, they have
lower missingness when grouping by several features at a time.

## Dates

The included files provide estimates for various metrics of interest over a
period of either a full epiweek (or [MMWR
week](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf), a
standardized numbering of weeks throughout the year) or a full calendar month.

## Aggregation

The aggregates are filtered to only include estimates for a particular group if
that group includes 100 or more responses. Especially in the weekly aggregates,
many of the state-level groups have been filtered out due to low sample size. In
such cases, the state marginal files, which group by a single demographic of
interest at a time, will likely provide more coverage.

## File Format

### Naming

Each CSV is named as follows:

    {date}_{region}_{vars}.csv

Dates are of the form `YYYYmmdd`. `date` refers to the first day of the time
period survey responses were aggregated over, in the Pacific time zone (UTC -
7). Unless noted otherwise, the time period is always a complete month or
epiweek. `region` is the geographic level responses were aggregated over. At the
moment, only nation-wide and state groupings are available. `vars` is a list all
other grouping variables used in the aggregation, ordered alphabetically.

### Columns

Within a CSV, the first few columns are the grouping variables, ordered
alphabetically. Each aggregate reports four columns (unrounded):

* `val_<indicator name>`: the main value of interest, e.g., percent, average, or
  count, estimated using the [survey weights](weights.md) to better match state
  demographics
* `se_<indicator name>`: the standard error of `val_<indicator name>`
* `sample_size_<indicator name>`: the number of survey responses used to
  calculate `val_<indicator name>`
* `represented_<indicator name>`: the number of people in the population that
  `val_<indicator name>` represents over all days in the given time period. This
  is the sum of [survey weights](./weights.md) for all survey responses
  used.

All aggregates using the same set of grouping variables appear in a single CSV.

## Indicators

The files contain [weighted estimates](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md#survey-weighting) of percent of
respondents who fulfill one or several criteria. Estimates are broken out by
state, age, gender, race, and ethnicity.

We plan to expand this list of indicators based on research needs; if you have a
public health or research need for a particular variable not listed here, please

Note: CSVs for the month of January 2021 only use data from January 6-31 due to
a [definitional change in a major vaccine item on January 6](./coding.md#new-items-2).
Indicators based on [item V9 use data starting January 12](./coding.md#new-items-2).
