#' Fetch all survey data in a chosen directory.
#'
#' There can be multiple data files for a single day of survey responses, for
#' example if the data is reissued when late-arriving surveys are recorded.
#' Each file contains *all* data recorded for that date, so only the later files
#' are needed.
#'
#' This function extracts the date from each file, determines which files are
#' reissued data, and produces a single data frame representing the most recent
#' data available for each day. It can read gzip-compressed CSV files, such as
#' those on the SFTP site, using `readr::read_csv`.
#'
#' This function handles column types correctly for surveys up to Wave 4.
#'
#' @param directory Directory in which to look for survey CSV files, relative to
#'   the current working directory.
#' @param pattern Regular expression indicating which files in that directory to
#'   open. By default, selects all `.csv.gz` files, such as those downloaded
#'   from the SFTP site.
#' @return A single data frame containing all survey responses. Note that this
#'   data frame may have millions of rows and use gigabytes of memory, if this
#'   function is run on *all* survey responses.
