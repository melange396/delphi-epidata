# Epidata API

The Epidata API provides real-time access to epidemiological surveillance data.
It is built and maintained by the Carnegie Mellon University [Delphi research
group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/). The Epidata API includes:

- The [COVIDcast API](api/covidcast.md), providing daily updates about COVID-19
  activity across the United States. [API clients](api/covidcast_clients.md) are
  available.
- The general [Epidata API](api/README.md), providing information about
  influenza, dengue, and other epidemics tracked by Delphi through a variety of
  data streams.

The Delphi group is extremely grateful for Pedrito Maynard-Zhang for all his
help with the Epidata API [documentation](api/index.md).

Developers interested in modifying or extending this project are directed to
the [Epidata API Development Guide](epidata_development.md).
